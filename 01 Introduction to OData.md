# An API, If to be called as a REST API, It needs to have the following properties:

# 1 üåê Uniform Interface in REST API

The **Uniform Interface** is one of the key principles of REST (Representational State Transfer). It ensures that all interactions between clients and servers follow a consistent and predictable pattern.

---



## ‚úÖ Why is Uniform Interface Important?

- Makes APIs **easy to understand**
- Allows **independent evolution** of client and server
- Improves **interoperability** between systems
- Supports **scalability** and **simplicity**

---

## üîë Key Principles of Uniform Interface

## 1. **Resource-Based Design**
- Everything is treated as a **resource** (like a user, product, or order).
- Each resource is identified by a **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier).

**Example: to get a User**

```http
GET /users/123

```

### Basically to summarize

`The server should send the representation of the data, based on the request from the client which will come in the form of a URI( Uniform Resource Identifier)`
`It should be having enough data( along with metadata) such that the client should understand...`


## 2. Standard HTTP Methods
REST uses standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources:

Method	Action	Example
`GET	Read data	GET /products/10`
`POST	Create new data	POST /orders`
`PUT	Update data	PUT /users/123`
`DELETE	Remove data	DELETE /users/123`


## 3. Resource Representation
Resources are not sent directly. Instead, they are represented in formats like JSON or XML.

Example JSON Response:

``` JSON
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Arman",
  "role": "SAP ABAP Developer"
}

```

## 4. Stateless Communication

server doesn't store the information of the client

Each request must contain all the information needed to process it. The server does not remember previous requests.

Example:


``` JSON

GET /users/123
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Even if you made a previous request, this one must include the token again.

## 5. Self-Descriptive Messages

Requests and responses should include enough information to understand how to handle them.

Example:

``` JSON

Content-Type: application/json

This tells the server that the request body is in JSON format.
```

## 6. HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)
Responses can include links to other actions or resources, guiding the client on what to do next.

Example Response:

``` JSON
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Arman",
  "links": [
    { "rel": "update", "href": "/users/123", "method": "PUT" },
    { "rel": "delete", "href": "/users/123", "method": "DELETE" }
  ]
}

```
üìò Real-World Example (SAP OData)
In SAP OData services, you might access a material like this:

``` JSON

GET /sap/opu/odata/sap/ZMATERIAL_SRV/MaterialSet('MAT123')
```

This follows the resource-based pattern.
Uses GET to retrieve data.
Returns JSON representation of the material.
Is stateless and self-descriptive.
