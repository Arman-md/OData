# 🌐 Uniform Interface in REST API

The **Uniform Interface** is one of the key principles of REST (Representational State Transfer). It ensures that all interactions between clients and servers follow a consistent and predictable pattern.

---

## ✅ Why is Uniform Interface Important?

- Makes APIs **easy to understand**
- Allows **independent evolution** of client and server
- Improves **interoperability** between systems
- Supports **scalability** and **simplicity**

---

## 🔑 Key Principles of Uniform Interface

### 1. **Resource-Based Design**
- Everything is treated as a **resource** (like a user, product, or order).
- Each resource is identified by a **URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier).

**Example: to get a User**

```http
GET /users/123
